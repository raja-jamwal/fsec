Fsec - Find bad Sectors on disk
Copyright (C) 2012  Raja Jamwal - linux1@zoho.com


Compilation instructions:
	
 gcc main.c -o fsec

Program parameters:
		
	./fsec --block-size <bs> --skip <sp>

<bs> : Block size, number of bytes to read in one go, this also determines our block unit
Bad sectors will be displayed in block unit, i.e 3 block or 5000 block

<sp> : Skip number of block (not bytes), this is done when a bad block is encountered,
Disk may or may not seek further once a bad block is encountered,
In such a scenario <sp> should be atleast 1 or any relavant value 
	
NOTE : status shown is <current byte>/<total byte>, the values may or may not be wrong,
depends on the condition of failing disk

In any case, the values shown in block units are final & should be considered
