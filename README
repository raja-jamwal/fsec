	Compilation instructions:
	
		gcc main.c -o fsec

	Program parameters:
		
		./fsec --block-size <bs> --skip <sp>

		<bs> : Block size, number of bytes to read in one go, this also determines our block unit
		       Bad sectors will be displayed in block unit, i.e 3 block or 5000 block

		<sp> : Skip number of block (not bytes), this is done when a bad block is encountered,
		       Disk may or may not seek further once a bad block is encountered,
		       In such a scenario <sp> should be atleast 1 or any relavant value 
	
	NOTE : status shown is <current byte>/<total byte>, the values may or may not be wrong,
	       depends on the condition of failing disk

	In any case, the values shown in block units are final & should be considered
